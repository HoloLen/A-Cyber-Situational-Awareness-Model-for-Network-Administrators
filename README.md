# A Cyber Situational Awareness Model For Network Administrator.

My master's thesis about cyber situational awareness.
The main goal of this thesis was to find out the way for perfect cyber situational awareness for network admins. However, there are a lot of factor in real life affecting perfect security. In this thesis I reviewed 3 important layers to reach to the main goal of information security: perfectly secure systems without any breaches. Of course this will not happen easily since human beings are analysing the data (logs, IPS, Firewalls... etc. ). Therefore, security is an important issue which needs to be worked on phase by phase.

ABSTRACT:

Although there are many well-established cyber security tools and techniques available to network
administrators for managing and defining their systems, attackers still succeed in penetrating their systems.
Defending these systemsâ€™ confidentiality, integrity, and availability is the responsibility of network
administrators; however, protecting these systems becomes more difficult when one considers the volume
and velocity of data provided by many of these cyber security tools. Often this data may actually indicate a
cyber-attack, but is hard to discern among the bulk of data provided. The purpose of this research is to
propose a cyber situational awareness (CSA) model to provide network administrators with better
situational awareness of cyber security threats to their systems. This research examines an established
situational awareness model and surveys cyber security practices and tools to extend this knowledge to
actual cyber situational awareness. This research further develops a model for CSA in three hierarchical
levels: configurational awareness, operational awareness, and special conditions awareness. The research
concludes that if network administrators manage their systems with awareness of these three levels, they
would be able to decrease the amount of unnecessary data and focus on the most important information
that can help them better guarantee cyber security of their systems.
